## Cybersecurity

[OpenAiExplain.py](https://github.com/s0cm0nkey/OpenAI_Interactions/blob/main/OpenAIExplain.py) - Simple python script that allows you to take a command line string that you are unfamilair with, and submit it to OpenAI to explain.
Super helpful for junior Security Analysts who are not as familiar with all of the commands and parameters found in CLI tools.
